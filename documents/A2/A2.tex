        % Purpose
        \section{Purpose}
        Lecturer team of 261111 - Internet and Online Community, Chiang Mai University have created this course to create realize in technology, internet and online community and proper behaviour of using it. Originally, the course itself are using typical way of evaluate the understanding - assignments and exams which is one-way activities. The lecturer team have decided to create a new way of evaluate the understanding of the students by creating a quiz application that students also contribute the quiz creation from the knowledge they have learned from the course and try to answer and review the contributed quizzes. The application will be called Crowd Quizmaker.
